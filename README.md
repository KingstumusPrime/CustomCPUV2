# Custom CPU V2

This project is a continuation to my [custom CPU](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/Custom-CPU-V1/). Instead of following a tutorial I wrote this one completly from scratch like no google for the week from scratch. That being said I took a lot of inspiration from the 6502 and NES for the CPU/PPU.

## Specs

### CPU

The CPU can be found in CPUV3 this is the most functional out of all of them and includes some basic 16 bit functionality (though it is rather forced to the point where I would not recomend it).

#### Features
* Two Registers A & X
* 8 Bit ram (technically 4 to help with lag)
* Carry, Zero, and Negitive flags
* 16 bit program rom
* 16 bit jumps
